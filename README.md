# DotFight
DotFight is an action infinite game where the player controls **Dot**, a cute little white circle who has to survive an attack of **evil dots**, many, many dull red circles.

I made this project thanks to [Archibald Perez](https://github.com/Archibald-Perez), who has been a great help making the project work and be as great as it is.

The project wasn’t on GitHub at first (started on the 27<sup>th</sup> of April 2022), but we decided quite early to push it on the platform.

This is an SVG/HTML/CSS/JS project, same as most of my recent ones.

## How to run the game
- [Download all project files](https://github.com/BarryCap/DotFight/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- Extract folder from ZIP
- Launch `dot.html` in a recent chromium-based browser (such as Chrome).

**Note** :
The game works best in full screen (<kbd>F11</kbd>) with a screen resolution higher than 1280 × 1024. If you have a lower screen resolution, you can zoom out to fit the game board.
