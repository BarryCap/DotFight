# DotFight
DotFight is an infinite action game where the player controls **Dot**, a cute little white circle who has to survive an attack of **evil dots**, many, many dull red circles.

I made this project thanks to [Archibald Perez](https://github.com/Archibald-Perez), who has been a great help making the project work and be as great as it is.

The project wasn’t on GitHub at first (started on the 27<sup>th</sup> of April 2022), but we decided quite early to push it on the platform.

This is an SVG/HTML/CSS/JS project (without using any libraries), same as most of my recent ones.

**Note**:
The game works best on computer, in full screen (<kbd>F11</kbd> or <kbd>Fn</kbd> + <kbd>F11</kbd>), in a Chromium-based browser (such as Chrome or Edge) and with a screen resolution higher than 1280 × 1024. If you have a lower screen resolution, you can zoom out (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Mouse Wheel Down</kbd>) to fit the game board.
