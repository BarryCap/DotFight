# DotFight
DotFight is an action infinite game where the player controls **Dot**, a cute little white circle who has to survive an attack of **evil dots**, many, many dull red circles.

I made this project thanks to [Archibald Perez](https://github.com/Archibald-Perez), who has been a great help making the project work and be as great as it is.

The project wasnâ€™t on GitHub at first (started on the 27<sup>th</sup> of April 2022), but we decided quite early to push it on the platform.

This is an SVG/HTML/CSS/JS project, same as most of my recent ones.
